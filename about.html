My name is Nathan Jenkins, I was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1993 where I was introduced to technology at an early age by my brother. As I went to school, I found my passion move into graphic design and video game design. I graduated from Belmont City College in 2011 and spent the next 7 years honing my skills as a designer.

In my spare time I'm an avid Dungeon & Dragons player, having been enjoying the series of games since 2007.

 
As of 2019, I've been an online student at RMIT, studying IT. My fascination with IT relates to the coding side of things, starting from a young age I was always intrigued by how a bunch of symbols and numbers could result in amazing applications. 
I knew I enjoyed video games as a child as well, so as my interest in IT grew, I wanted to find out how those video games I loved were made. This sparked my interest in to programming to the nth degree and I knew I had to learn more. 7 years later, here we are!<br>
<br>
I've been apart of multiple video game design projects but always felt like I wanted to do more than just submitting a tiny piece of content that may never be used, I wanted to make a game myself. Hence, my desire to head to RMIT, learn coding, so that I may become
a Indie Developer on my own.<br>
<br>
I also went to RMIT due to my requirement to study online. My schedule currently is just way too hectic to include physically going to a university campus and sitting in class, doing online courses really fit that requirement rather well. As for RMIT specifically, well, I figured
studying Information Technology at the Melbourne Institute of Technology made a lot of sense.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping my studies at RMIT will give me the "foot in the door" to the world of IT as a career, as well as allow me to follow my passion of video game design.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b><u>My Ideal Job</b></u>

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="https://i.ibb.co/4ZJXfsQ/Ideal-Job-Snapshot.png" alt="Ideal-Job-Snapshot" border="0">
<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
My ideal job is something that can provide the gear and systems that are generally used in video games to a more broader field or used in a way to educate or help people in my community. 
The closest job I could find matching this description was for a AR/VR Technical Officer for my local university.<br> (<i>The current job posting has since expired on the advertised website and is no longer available.</i>)<br>
<br>
The position would be using AR/VR programs and hardware to create digital experiences for the university students to assist in their learnings and provide a new means for them to create their projects that would otherwise be too difficult or expensive.<br>
<br>For example: An engineering student is doing a project on a new type of suspension bridge and would like to show their instructor what the proposed bridge would look like. In theory, the student could use an AR or VR application to create a small-scale model of their project and show it to their instructor.<br>
This position fits almost perfectly with my personal description of the ideal job I'd love to partake in life, as it's using technology that, in the limelight is generally used for video games, however has been repurposed for a teaching application.<br>
<br>
To be qualified for this position, it would be expected for me to possess:
<ul>
<li> Experience and knowledge of AR and VR systems.</li>
<li> Experience and knowledge of coding languages to be used to create AR and VR application.</li>
<li> Experience and knowledge of IT systems used in the school. </li>
<li> Ability to work both independantly and within a team. </li>
<li> Personal communication skills. </li>
<li> Ability to meet deadlines efficiently. </li>
<li> Ability to pass Government checks for working with students and in Australia. </li>
</ul>
<br>
For me, a lot of the qualifications on this list are more social and work-ethic related and I already possess these due to having had experience in the Retail industry.<br>
<br>
As a Retail employee, each shift I was given a deadline to have my work done (usually the end of the shift) and was left alone to ensure it was completed. Should I finish before the end of the shift, I was instructed to assist another co-worker to complete their work.<br>
This matches the "<b>Ability to work both independantly and within a team</b>" qualification, as well as the "<b>Ability to meet deadlines efficiently.</b>" qualification. On top of this, I would often have to communicate with customers and assist them in their shopping needs.
This could translate in to the "<b>Personal communication skills</b>" qualification.<br>
<br>
It is more the IT side of things wherein I require more training and experience. I've had many years working in an artistic field but have had little exposure to 3D models, AR/VR tracking or using virtual workspaces. <br>
<br>
In order to obtain the qualifications that I am lacking in, I would perhaps look into the Unity3D and Unreal Engine environments and their documentation on AR and VR in order to gain some general knowledge, whilst continuing my studies in IT as it covers AR/VR systems.<br>
<br>
The Bachelor of IT degree would potentially be enough for the employer to consider me for an interview, wherein I would display my acquired knowledge of AR and VR systems through possibly prepared examples or some general reassurance of my knowledge acquired
through my degree and my personal research into AR and VR documentation.<br>

<center><b><u>My Personal Profile</b></u></center>
<br>
To determine my ability to learn, socialize and contribute in teams, I took three personality tests: The Myers Briggs Test, The Learning Style Test and the Big Five Personality Test. The results were fairly close to what I was expecting with a few values a bit higher or lower than expected. The results seem to paint the picture of someone who enjoys structure in a project but not at the expense at other's feelings.
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
<b><center> Myers Briggs Test</b></center>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
The test results paint an image of someone that prefers structure and stability but not at the cost of other people's feelings. This, to me, seems fairly accurate in regards to my own personality. The part that poses a potential problem is the high percentile of introversion, which, makes me a little worried when it comes to<br>
working in teams in a real environment (as opposed to working via correspondance.) and is something that I would have to look at working on in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
Judging from the test's findings, I will definitely find myself being more careful not to come across as bossy or opinionated, as I may want to assert a structured working environment and this <i>can</i> have a negative effect on team morale. Knowing my flaws allows me to work on them for the benefit of my fellow team
members and will surely be in the back of my mind throughout the entirety of a project. A method I will certainly look at employing is to take a bit of a "back seat" to allow other team members their moment to take more of a lead. (Not to a level where I'm considered uncooperative or lazy, of course.)<br>

<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
When forming a team, I should perhaps look out for individuals that take <i>too</i> lax of an attitude, as this may cause personality clashes. At the same time, on my end of things, I should take caution not to try and take over and control the group to match my preferences in terms of work ethics.
I think if I'm aware that I can be a little too eager to take a leadership role, keep my personal preferences in check and really remind myself of team etiquette, I should be fairly cohesive in a team environment.

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
<b><center> Learning Style Test</b></center>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
These results actually greatly assist me when it comes to trying to retain information for studies and projects. A common problem for me in the past was being instructed on something by simply being told the work required, would often result in me forgetting exactly what needed to be done. 
Knowing that if I simply ask to be <i>shown</i> exactly what needs to be done, I can have a higher chance of retaining the information, can potentially increase my productivity by quite a lot.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
I think I'm now more inclined to ask my fellow team members to perhaps do a quick sketch of the ideas they're trying to convey, or find a way to show me instead of tell me the information they are trying to get across. I understand that this may be a bit annoying to some, so perhaps an alternative to
that would be taking notes on what my fellow team members are trying to say and refer to said notes when discussing the topic.<br>
<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
Ensuring that I'm taking notes on everything my fellow team members say and using imagery to further communicate<br> my own ideas can be the thing that makes or breaks how well I work with others. In the team-forming stages, it's difficult to gauge <br>exactly how the other members would work but
by having my own bases covered, I don't forsee it being an issue.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
<br>
<b>Big Five Personality Test</b><br>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
The results show I have rather high Openness and Agreeableness which can absolutely be highly regarded aspects to some people,<br> it's the high Neuroticism that's got me a touch concerned, (<i>Oh, the irony.</i>) as I am worried that my emotional side of things can potentially<br> be harmful to team environments
and detrimental for my own well being in professional circumstances. Constructive critism can be inadvertently<br> taken personally if I'm using my emotions instead of my logical reasoning to absorb the information.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
The low Extraversion and high Neuroticism doesn't bode well for a team-player and it's certainly something I'd want to keep in check. Ensuring that<br> anything professionally critical about the work I contribute isn't taken personally is definitely a thing I need to work on and will be ensuring as I move<br> forward.
I'm also taking steps to be more social in regards to my fellow students in my IT course, and I'm hopeful that this will transfer nicely into a professional aspect.<br>
<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
I think being upfront with how I work and openly communicative with potential team-mates is key. Letting professional colleagues know that I am open to communication<br> and not taking everything they say or do personally will be vital in my professional career in the future. The moderate level of Conscientiousness
will be something I need to work on if I am to be seen as a highly sought after partner in a professional sense, showing that I can be careful and collected in my methods of work.
