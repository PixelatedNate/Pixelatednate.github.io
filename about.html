<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
My name is Nathan Jenkins, I was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1993 where I was introduced to technology at an early age by my brother.<br> As I went to school, I found my passion move into graphic design and video game design. I graduated from Belmont City College in 2011 and spent the next 7 years honing my skills as a designer.
In my spare time I'm an avid Dungeon & Dragons player, having been enjoying the series of games since 2007, I enjoy playing video games on the Nintendo Switch and finding new and interesting restaurants around my city.<br>
<br>
As of 2019, I've been an online student at RMIT, studying IT. My fascination with IT relates to the coding side of things, starting from a young age I was always intrigued by how a bunch of symbols and numbers could result in amazing applications.
I knew I enjoyed video games as a child as well, so as my interest in IT grew, I wanted to find out how those video games I loved were made. This sparked my interest in to programming to the nth degree and I knew I had to learn more. 7 years later, here we are!<br> 
<br>I've been apart of multiple video game design projects but always felt like I wanted to do more than just submitting a tiny piece of content that may never be used, I wanted to make a game myself. Hence, my desire to head to RMIT, learn coding, so that I may become
a Indie Developer on my own.<br>
<br>I also went to RMIT due to my requirement to study online. My schedule currently is just way too hectic to include physically going to a university campus and sitting in class, doing online courses really fit that requirement rather well. As for RMIT specifically, well, I figured
studying Information Technology at the Melbourne Institute of Technology made a lot of sense.<br>
I'm hoping my studies at RMIT will give me the "foot in the door" to the world of IT as a career, as well as allow me to follow my passion of video game design.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b><u>My Ideal Job</b></u>

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="https://i.ibb.co/4ZJXfsQ/Ideal-Job-Snapshot.png" alt="Ideal-Job-Snapshot" border="0">
<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
My ideal job is something that can provide the gear and systems that are generally used in video games to a more broader field or used in a way to educate or help people in my community. 
The closest job I could find matching this description was for a AR/VR Technical Officer for my local university.<br> (<i>The current job posting has since expired on the advertised website and is no longer available.</i>)<br>
<br>
The position would be using AR/VR programs and hardware to create digital experiences for the university students to assist in their learnings and provide a new means for them to create their projects that would otherwise be too difficult or expensive.<br>
<br>For example: An engineering student is doing a project on a new type of suspension bridge and would like to show their instructor what the proposed bridge would look like. In theory, the student could use an AR or VR application to create a small-scale model of their project and show it to their instructor.<br>
This position fits almost perfectly with my personal description of the ideal job I'd love to partake in life, as it's using technology that, in the limelight is generally used for video games, however has been repurposed for a teaching application.<br>
<br>
To be qualified for this position, it would be expected for me to possess:
<ul>
<li> Experience and knowledge of AR and VR systems.</li>
<li> Experience and knowledge of coding languages to be used to create AR and VR application.</li>
<li> Experience and knowledge of IT systems used in the school. </li>
<li> Ability to work both independantly and within a team. </li>
<li> Personal communication skills. </li>
<li> Ability to meet deadlines efficiently. </li>
<li> Ability to pass Government checks for working with students and in Australia. </li>
</ul>
<br>
For me, a lot of the qualifications on this list are more social and work-ethic related and I already possess these due to having had experience in the Retail industry.<br>
As a Retail employee, each shift I was given a deadline to have my work done (usually the end of the shift) and was left alone to ensure it was completed. Should I finish before the end of the shift, I was instructed to assist another co-worker to complete their work.<br>
This matches the "<b>Ability to work both independantly and within a team</b>" qualification, as well as the "<b>Ability to meet deadlines efficiently.</b>" qualification. On top of this, I would often have to communicate with customers and assist them in their shopping needs.
This could translate in to the "<b>Personal communication skills</b>" qualification.<br>
It is more the IT side of things wherein I require more training and experience. I've had 7 years experience working with 2D art and have had little exposure to 3D models, AR/VR tracking or using virtual workspaces. <br>
<br>
In order to obtain the qualifications that I am lacking in, I would perhaps look into the Unity3D and Unreal Engine environments and their documentation on AR and VR in order to gain some general knowledge, whilst continuing my studies in IT as it covers AR/VR systems. 
The Bachelor of IT degree would potentially be enough for the employer to consider me for an interview, wherein I would display my acquired knowledge of AR and VR systems through possibly prepared examples or some general reassurance of my knowledge acquired
through my degree and my personal research into AR and VR documentation.<br>

<center><b><u>My Personal Profile</b></u></center>
<br>
To determine my ability to learn, socialize and contribute in teams, I took three personality tests: The Myers Briggs Test, The Learning Style Test and the Big Five Personality Test. The results were fairly close to what I was expecting with a few values a bit higher or lower than expected. The results seem to paint the picture of someone who enjoys structure in a project but not at the expense at other's feelings.
<br>

<b><center> Myers Briggs Test</b></center>
The Myers Briggs Test results didn't really suprise me too much, as I am aware of my introverted nature, I feel like this portion of the results wouldn't have too much of an impact on working in a team as that is more of a personal side, as opposed to professional, though it may cause some social rifts between team members. <br>
<br>The marginal preference of Sensing over Intuition seems almost too small to actually have an impact on anything, I feel it's important to have both aspects when working on a project with a team. <br>
<br>The slight rift between Feeling and Thinking was a bit of suprise to me, as I actually thought it was the reverse for me. I think it may be a positive for team work as I know that in each team, many people have different levels of experience and knowledge, this "feeling" aspect could potentially reduce my odds of getting frustrated with those that I disagree with, which is certainly something that can make or break a team project, by putting myself in their shoes, so to speak.<br>
<br> The Judgement over Perceiving portion doesn't suprise me much either, as according to the Myers Briggs website, this aspect is to do with ones personal lifestyle, preferring Judgement over  Perceiving meaning that I prefer a "structured environment" which is absolutely accurate. Whilst working in Retail, my daily routine for getting ready for work was scarcely different and I tended to follow said routine to the T every day of the week for multiple years.<br>
This could be both detrimental <i>and</i> beneficial for a team, as if the team are also structured and coordinated, we would work rather well together, however if they were more relaxed or laid back about the work, I'd possibly come across as pushy or strict; and potentially cause problems amongst teams.<br>
