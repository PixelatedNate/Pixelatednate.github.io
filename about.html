<p style="margin-top: 20px;">My name is Nathan Jenkins, I was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1993 where I was introduced to technology at an early age by my brother. As I went to school, I found my passion move into graphic design and video game design. I graduated from Belmont City College in 2011 and spent the next 7 years honing my skills as a designer.</p>
<p>In my spare time I'm an avid Dungeon & Dragons player, having been enjoying the series of games since 2007.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>As of 2019, I've been an online student at RMIT.</p>
