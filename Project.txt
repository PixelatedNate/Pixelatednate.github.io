<br>
My current project is to design a video game using Unity3D. The game will be a 2D, Platformer/Brawler hybrid using Pixel Art graphics for that "retro" feel.<br>
Whilst the main portion of the game is the Platformer/Brawler campaign, an additional mode will be 
a 4-player arena battle mode wherein players try to knock their opponents in to hazards.</center><br>

<h1><center><b><u>Motivation</b></u></center></h1>
<br>

The Muscle Wizard game is interesting due to it being highly influenced from successful games,<i> Shovel Knight</i> and <i>Guacamelee</i>. Guacamelee, the project's gameplay influence, has an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 players since its release in 2013. Shovel Knight, on the other hand, the project's artistic influence, has an estimated 500,000 to 1 million players since its release in 2014.<br>
<br> 
Making a statistical estimation, if we take the average of these values, we're looking at a hypothetical sale estimate of 392,500 units. Were the game to be valued at $10, you can quickly see how valuable such a project could be.<br>
<br>
(<i>This of course isn't solid evidence, as the video game market is highly unpredictable, just because the two games mentioned were successful, doesn't necessarily mean Muscle Wizard will be also.</i>)<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
It has also been common knowledge for quite some time that video games, if consumed in a healthy manner, can have positive cognitive effects. Such effects include:<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><li> Improves coordination.</li>
<li> Improves problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>Enhances memory. </li>
<li> Improves attention and concentration.</li>
<li> Enhances multitasking skills. </li>
<li> And improves the brain's speed. </li></b>

<br>
These two aspects serve as great motivation to complete this project and see it be released for public consumption.<br>

<br>
<h1><center><b><u>Overview</b></u></center><br></h1>
The Muscle Wizard game is presented as a 2D Platformer/Brawler hybrid. Players move the main character, a very muscular wizard, through levels, maneuvering around objects and hazards and fighting enemies through a mixture of fantasy magic and American styled wrestling moves.
As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock new characters to play as, as well as level up their own character, which garners additional health, magic and a skill point to be spent on a skill tree to unlock new abilities.<br> 
<br>
In addition to this gameplay, at any point, up to three players can join (For a total of four players) to cooperatively assist in the game, playing as either colour-coded versions of the first Wizard character or, if unlocked, one of the other characters.<br>
<br>
The game's general theme parodies traditional fantasy themes as well as lampoons alpha-male tropes. In traditional fantasy, the Wizard is often seen as a "glass cannon", a term that is used to describe their high attack output but low defense. I thought it would be humorous to pair said 
idea with alpha-male tropes and alpha-male hyperbole for comedic value.<br>

In terms of narrative, the premise is fairly simple:<i> A Wizard is ridiculed by his adventuring team, so he departs, vowing to complete a quest on his own to show them he isn't weak. As he adventures, he comes across other magic users that wish to aid the Wizard in their quest, which slowly takes
a darker turn towards political espionage, dark prophecies and ancient secrets.</i><br>
<br>
In short, it's a bait-and-switch story. The main characters believe they are completing a simple quest when in reality it has much deeper complications, which they will need to arise to the challenge to overcome.<br>
<br>
On top of the main campaign of the game, there will also be an additional game mode in which multiple players choose one of the unlocked characters, choose an arena map to fight in and proceed to try to knock the other players in to hazards using a stripped down version of the wrestling maneuvers and magical abilities present in the game.<br>

<h1><center><b><u>Technologies</b></u><br></h1>
For this project, what is mainly used in terms of software is Unity3D, Aseprite and FL Studio. Unity3D is the core program required, as this is the software used to design the game and export it as a functioning program that can be run.<br>
<br>
Aseprite is the program I use to draw the various images and animations that is exported into Unity3D to then be manipulated via code.<br>
<br>
FL Studio is the program used to design the music and sounds present in the project. After creating the files, they too are exported to Unity3D to be manipulated through the code. The use of this program is left until the end of the production cycle, however, and is used the least, compared to the other two.<br>
<br>
Through the use of these three softwares, I believe it is absolutely possible to create the project without the need for other systems. Of course, there is the requirement of a Personal Computer to run said software. Optional hardware may be a Waicom Drawing Tablet to assist in illustrations or a USB GamePad for prototype testing.<br>

<br>
<br>

<h1><center><b><u>Skill Requirements</b></u><br></h1>
The skill requirements for this project are rather steep and and I certainly wouldn't suggest it to anyone that is not confident in their skills as either an artist, programmer or designer. The entire project would require:<br>
<br><center>
<li>Artistic skills in producing Pixel Art characters, tiles, effects and backgrounds.</li>
<li>Programming skills in either C# or Java coding language. </li>
<li>Video game design skills, including level design and UI design.</li>
<li>Musical ability and the know-how to produce music and sound effects from software.</li>
<li>Experience with Unity3D.</li>
<li>Marketing know-how in a highly competitive, uncertain working field.</li><br></center>
As such, for a student project, I would <b>not</b> suggest this project for a team assignment. The extent of time and effort that goes in to making a video game far outreaches the norm for any kind of deadline in the beginning stages and should be confined to either a hobbyist or professional capacity.<br>

<br>
<br> 

<h1><center><b><u>Outcome</b></u><br></h1>
Should the project eventually be finished, the outcome would be a potentially profitable product that can be marketed and sold to consumers on multiple gaming platforms. If the project is designed correctly, there will also be a framework there for additional content to be added post-launch (Downloadable Content)
as well as a solid foundation for a potential sequel for the game. Online communities also have a tendency to arise around projects such as these, to discuss and socialise with other fans of the product. This is certainly another potential outcome and would be beneficial for creating a possible following for future projects.<br>
